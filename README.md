Assemble many Dockerfiles in a single Dockerfile. This gives you the convenience of one Docker image with your favorite tools while keeping the modularity of a separate Dockerfile per tool.

See [Code Cleaner Buffet](https://github.com/evolutics/code-cleaner-buffet) for an application of this.

## Terminology
